#Business card generation scripts

I recently felt the need to have a weird graph like object for the back
of my business cards. This is the result.

![Card back](http://samphippen.com/back.png)

##Usage

    python back.py

the output will be in `back.png`.

Running with no arguments will produce a graph as above. Running with the `--colour-edges` (or `-c`) flag will colour the edges randomly. Run with the `-h` flag for help.
